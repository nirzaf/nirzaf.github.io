**Searching web for blogging site plan**

The user wants a design plan for a blog site using Next.js and MDX files. I’ll need to search for resources on Next.js architecture, how MDX integrates with it, and key features of successful blogging sites like Medium. I’ll check documentation from Next.js, MDX-specific sites, and analyze Medium’s platform features. After gathering full details, I will compile a structured summary with citations from at least five sources, ensuring I get 15 citations in total.


**Preparing blog design plan and features**

To create a Next.js blog with MDX, I'll start by gathering information from multiple sources. I’ll look up the platform's architecture, folder structure, routing process, and useful features like SEO, comments, and tag pages. For Medium, I’ll explore key features like personalization, code blocks, and WYSIWYG. The final response will include a design plan, features for engagement and usability, and 15 citations from the relevant documentation and guides. I'll organize the results and summarize the essential components in a clear structure.


Thought for 16 seconds


Before diving into the specifics, here’s a high-level overview: we’ll build a statically-generated Next.js application using its App Router and MDX for content; MDX files will live in a dedicated folder, parsed at build time to create dynamic routes with `generateStaticParams`; helper utilities (e.g., for frontmatter parsing) and a consistent folder structure will keep the code maintainable; we’ll integrate SEO and performance optimizations (metadata, sitemap, `next/image`), and deploy to Vercel. On top of this foundation, the site will include all “Medium-style” features—from a distraction-free reading experience, claps/reactions, and highlights, to tagging, search, comments, related posts, and subscription/newsletter support.

## Architecture and Design Plan

### 1. Tech Stack Overview

* **Next.js App Router** for file-based routing and server components ([dimitrisanastasiadis.com][1]).
* **MDX** to write Markdown with embedded JSX components ([Next.js][2]).
* **Contentlayer** (or `next-mdx-remote`) for parsing MDX frontmatter into a typed data layer ([Ben Orloff Blog][3]).
* **Tailwind CSS** (or a similar utility-first library) for consistent styling ([DEV Community][4]).
* **Cypress** for end-to-end testing of blog posts and image loading.
* **Vercel** for seamless deployment and edge caching.

### 2. Folder Structure

```
/app
  /blog
    /[slug]
      page.tsx        ← Renders individual posts
    page.tsx          ← Renders paginated list of posts
/lib
  mdxUtils.ts         ← MDX/frontmatter helper functions
/components
  Layout.tsx          ← Site header/footer/layout
  PostCard.tsx        ← Blog list preview card
  SEO.tsx             ← Metadata component
/public
  /images             ← Static images
/data
  /posts              ← *.mdx source files
next.config.js
tsconfig.json
```

* Dynamic routes in `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` use `generateStaticParams` to SSG each post ([dimitrisanastasiadis.com][1]).

### 3. Content Sourcing and Parsing

* Place each blog post as an `.mdx` file under `/data/posts`, with YAML frontmatter for `title`, `description`, `date`, `tags`, and `image` ([dimitrisanastasiadis.com][1]).
* Use `@next/mdx` plugin (or `next-mdx-remote`) to transform MDX into React components during build ([Next.js][2]).
* Implement a utility (`mdxUtils.ts`) that reads all filenames, parses frontmatter into a typed array, and exports helper functions like `getPostSlugs()` and `getPostBySlug(slug)`.

### 4. Data Layer and Build Process

* **generateStaticParams** (Next.js App Router) fetches slugs and pre-builds pages ([dimitrisanastasiadis.com][1]).
* **generateMetadata** in each page component dynamically constructs SEO metadata per post (open graph tags, canonical URLs).
* Build a `/sitemap.xml` by iterating over all slugs to improve indexing.

### 5. UI Components

* **Layout**: Global header (logo, nav links), footer (copyright, social links).
* **Typography**: Scalable font sizes, comfortable line length, dark mode toggle.
* **PostCard**: Title, excerpt, date, tags, estimated reading time.
* **MDXComponents**: Custom `<Tweet>`, `<Gallery>`, or `<Chart>` for embedding interactive React components within posts ([DEV Community][4]).

### 6. SEO & Performance

* Use `next/image` for optimized images with `priority` on hero images.
* Preload critical CSS and fonts.
* Add JSON-LD structured data for articles.
* Implement lazy-loading for comments and related posts.

### 7. Testing

* **Cypress** for comprehensive end-to-end testing of blog functionality.
* Automated tests covering all aspects of the blog:
  * Navigation and layout
  * Homepage functionality
  * Blog index page and post cards
  * Individual blog post rendering and MDX content
  * Tags pages and filtering
  * About page
  * 404 page handling
  * SEO and metadata
  * Accessibility compliance
  * Responsive design across devices
* Visual regression testing with screenshots.
* Custom commands for reusable test patterns.

npm run cypress:open

# Run all tests headlessly
npm run cypress:run

# Run specific test files
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/blog-post-detail.cy.ts"

# Run tests with npm test (alias for cypress:run)
npm test
```

#### Automated Build-Run-Test-Push Workflow

This project includes an automated workflow script that follows the guidelines in `.windsurf/rules/build-run-test-push.md`. The workflow:

1. Terminates any existing Node.js processes running the development script
2. Executes `npm run dev`
3. After changes, builds the project
4. If the build succeeds, runs the project
5. Tests the project
6. If all tests pass, pushes the changes to the repository
7. Creates a backup branch with a timestamp

To run the workflow:

```bash
# Run the complete workflow
npm run workflow
```

This script is particularly useful for:
- Ensuring all changes are properly tested before being pushed
- Creating automatic backup branches after successful builds
- Maintaining a clean development workflow

#### Test Files

* `navigation-layout.cy.ts` - Tests for navigation, header, footer, and theme toggle
* `homepage.cy.ts` - Tests for homepage content and functionality
* `blog-index-detailed.cy.ts` - Tests for blog index page and post cards
* `blog-post-detail.cy.ts` - Tests for individual blog posts and MDX rendering
* `tags.cy.ts` - Tests for tags index and individual tag pages
* `about.cy.ts` - Tests for about page content
* `not-found.cy.ts` - Tests for 404 page handling
* `seo-metadata.cy.ts` - Tests for SEO and metadata across all pages
* `accessibility.cy.ts` - Tests for accessibility compliance
* `responsive-design.cy.ts` - Tests for responsive design across devices

### 8. Deployment

* Push to GitHub, connect to Vercel for CI/CD.
* Ensure environment variables (if any) are configured in Vercel dashboard.
* Leverage edge caching for static assets and ISR (incremental static regeneration) if you enable on-demand rebuilds.

### 9. CI/CD and Automated Workflows

#### GitHub Actions Workflows

This project includes two GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **Build and Deploy** (`build-and-deploy.yml`)
   * Triggered on push to the `main` branch and pull requests
   * Installs dependencies, builds the project, and runs tests
   * Automatically handles package.json and package-lock.json mismatches by:
     * First trying `npm ci` for faster, more reliable builds
     * If that fails, falling back to `npm install` to update package-lock.json
     * Committing the updated package-lock.json file if needed

2. **Create Backup Branch After Successful Build** (`backup-after-build.yml`)
   * Triggered after a successful build on the `main` branch
   * Creates a backup branch with a timestamp and the commit message
   * Keeps only the 10 most recent backup branches

#### Handling Package.json and Package-lock.json Mismatches

If you encounter issues with mismatches between package.json and package-lock.json, you can:

1. Use the provided script to fix the issue locally:
   ```bash
   npm run sync-deps
   ```
   This script will:
   - Remove node_modules and package-lock.json
   - Generate a clean package-lock.json without installing modules
   - Install dependencies properly using npm ci or npm install as a fallback

2. Commit the updated package-lock.json file:
   ```bash
   git add package-lock.json
   git commit -m "chore: update package-lock.json to match package.json"
   git push
   ```

3. Let the GitHub Actions workflow handle it automatically:
   * Push your changes to the `main` branch
   * The workflow will detect the mismatch and fix it
   * It will commit the updated package-lock.json file

#### TypeScript Configuration

The project includes proper TypeScript configuration for both Next.js and Cypress:

1. **Main TypeScript Configuration** (`tsconfig.json`):
   - Includes `baseUrl` set to the root directory
   - Configures path aliases for imports
   - Includes all TypeScript files in the project

2. **Cypress TypeScript Configuration** (`cypress/tsconfig.json`):
   - Extends the main configuration
   - Adds Cypress-specific types
   - Disables isolatedModules for better compatibility with Cypress
