## How to Enable Multi-Factor Authentication using Microsoft Authenticator App for Office 365 Accounts

### What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), also known as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), is a security feature that provides an additional layer of protection for your online accounts. Think of it as adding a second lock to your front door‚Äîeven if someone has your key (password), they still can't get in without the second key (verification code).

**Why is MFA important?**
- üîí It significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your accounts
- üõ°Ô∏è Even if your password is compromised, hackers still need the second factor to gain access
- üì± The second factor is typically something only you physically possess (like your phone)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è According to Microsoft, MFA can block over 99.9% of account compromise attacks

### What You'll Need
- An Office 365 account
- A smartphone (iOS or Android)
- Internet connection
- 5-10 minutes of your time

### Overview of the Process

Setting up MFA with Microsoft Authenticator involves four simple steps:

1. Download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app on your phone
2. Configure your Office 365 account to use the Authenticator app
3. Link your account to the app by scanning a QR code
4. Set up a backup verification method (just in case)

Let's walk through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Download and install the Microsoft Authenticator App

</div>

> **Tip**: Make sure to place the Microsoft Authenticator app on your home screen for easy access. You'll be using it frequently when signing in to your accounts.

### Step 2: Set up Microsoft Authenticator App as your verification method

**On your computer (not your phone):**

1. **Access your Office 365 account**:
   - Open a web browser (like Chrome, Edge, Safari, or Firefox)
   - Go to [portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com)
   - Sign in with your Office 365 email address and password

2. **Navigate to security settings**:
   - If you see a message saying "More information required" or "Set up your account", you're in the right place‚Äîclick "Next" or "Set it up now"
   - If you don't see these messages, manually go to the MFA setup page by typing [https://aka.ms/mfasetup](https://aka.ms/mfasetup) in your browser address bar

3. **Access security info settings**:
   - You should now be on a page titled "Security info"
   - Look for the "+ Add sign-in method" or "+ Add method" button and click it

4. **Select Authenticator app**:
   - A dropdown menu will appear with different verification methods
   - Select "Authenticator app" from the list
   - A new screen will appear with setup options

5. **Choose notification method**:
   - You'll see two options:
     - "Receive notifications for verification" (recommended for beginners)
     - "Use verification code"
   - Make sure the first option is selected (it's usually the default)

6. **Start the setup process**:
   - Click the "Set up" button to proceed
   - The next screen will display a QR code‚Äî**don't close this window!**
   - You'll need to keep this screen open while completing the next step on your phone

> **Note**: If you're setting this up on a work computer, you might need administrator permissions. If you encounter any issues, contact your IT support team.

### Step 3: Scan the QR code to link your app to your account

**Now, pick up your phone** with the Microsoft Authenticator app installed. You'll need to use both your computer and phone for this step.

  <p className="font-medium">Important:</p>
  <p>Keep the QR code displayed on your computer screen while completing these steps on your phone.</p>
</div>

**On your phone:**

1. **Open the Microsoft Authenticator app** you installed in Step 1

2. **Add your account**:
   - Tap the **+** (plus) icon in the upper-right corner of the app
   - Select **Work or school account** from the menu
   - You may see a prompt asking for camera access‚Äîtap **Allow** (this is necessary to scan the QR code)

3. **Scan the QR code**:
   - Point your phone's camera at the QR code displayed on your computer screen
   - Hold the phone steady until the app recognizes the code (you don't need to take a picture)
   - The app will automatically detect the QR code when properly aligned

> **Troubleshooting**: If the QR code scan doesn't work, most setup screens offer a manual entry option with a code you can type into the app instead of scanning.

### Step 4: Add your phone number as a backup option

**Why this step matters**: Adding a backup verification method ensures you can still access your account if you lose your phone or can't use the Authenticator app for any reason. This is a critical step that many people skip‚Äîdon't make that mistake!

**On your computer:**

1. **Enter your backup phone number**:
   - After completing the Authenticator app setup, you'll be prompted to add a backup method
   - Select **Phone** as your backup method if it's not already selected
   - Enter your complete mobile phone number, including the country code (e.g., +1 for USA, +44 for UK)
   - Select whether you want to receive verification codes via **text message** (recommended) or **phone call**

![Step 4: Add your phone number](https://ik.imagekit.io/fazrinphcc/MultiFactorAuthentication/page4.jpg?updatedAt=1717915666241)

2. **Verify your phone number**:
   - Click **Next** to proceed
   - Within a few moments, you'll receive a text message with a 6-digit verification code on your phone
   - Check your text messages and note the verification code
   - Enter this code in the verification field on your computer
   - Click **Verify** to confirm

### How to Use MFA After Setup

Now that you've set up MFA, here's what to expect when signing in to your Office 365 account:

1. **First sign-in factor**: Enter your email and password as usual

2. **Second sign-in factor**: You'll be prompted for additional verification in one of two ways:
   - **Push notification**: Your phone will receive a notification asking you to approve the sign-in
   - **Verification code**: You may be asked to enter a code from the Authenticator app

3. **Approving sign-ins**:
   - When you receive a notification, open it and review the sign-in details
   - Only tap **Approve** if you recognize the sign-in attempt
   - If you didn't try to sign in, tap **Deny** to block the unauthorized access attempt

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Lost or new phone?**
- Use your backup phone number verification method to sign in
- Contact your IT administrator if you can't access your account

**Not receiving notifications?**
- Check that notifications are enabled for the Microsoft Authenticator app
