## How to Enable Multi-Factor Authentication using Microsoft Authenticator App for Office 365 Accounts

MFA/(2FA) is a security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to your Office 365 account. With MFA, you need to provide both your password and a verification code from your mobile device to sign into your account. This makes it harder for hackers to access your account even if they know your password.

To enable MFA using the Microsoft Authenticator App, you need to download and install the app on your mobile device, set it up as your verification method, and scan a QR code to link it to your account. Here are the steps to do that:

### Step 1: Download and install the Microsoft Authenticator App

- Go to the App Store/Play Store on your mobile device and search for Microsoft Authenticator.
- Download and install the app on your device.
- Open the app and accept the terms of use and privacy policy.
