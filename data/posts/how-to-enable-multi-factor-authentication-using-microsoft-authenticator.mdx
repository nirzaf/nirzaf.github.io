What is Multi-Factor Authentication?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra security layer to your Office 365 account by requiring two forms of verification:
1. Something you know (your password)
2. Something you have (your phone with the Authenticator app)

This prevents unauthorized access even if your password is compromised. Microsoft reports that MFA blocks over 99.9% of account compromise attempts.

### What You'll Need
- Office 365 account
- Smartphone (iOS or Android)
- Internet connection
- 5-10 minutes

### Setup Process Overview
1. Download Microsoft Authenticator app
2. Configure your Office 365 account
3. Link your account by scanning a QR code
4. Add a backup verification method

### Step 1: Download Microsoft Authenticator App

**For iPhone:**
- Open App Store and search for "Microsoft Authenticator"
- Download and install the app from Microsoft Corporation
- Open the app and accept terms of use
- Allow notifications when prompted

**For Android:**
- Open Google Play Store and search for "Microsoft Authenticator"
- Download and install the app from Microsoft Corporation

### Step 4: Add a Backup Method

Adding a backup method is critical in case you lose access to your phone or the Authenticator app.

2. Enter your mobile number with country code (e.g., +1 for USA)
3. Choose "Text message" for verification (recommended)

### Using MFA After Setup

**Daily Sign-in Process:**
1. Enter your email and password as usual
2. You'll receive either:
   - A push notification on your phone (tap Approve)
   - A prompt to enter a verification code from the app

**Important Security Tips:**
- Only approve sign-ins you initiated yourself
- If you receive an unexpected authentication request, deny it and change your password immediately
- Keep your phone secure as it's now part of your login security

### Troubleshooting

- **Lost phone?** Use your backup phone number to sign in
- **No notifications?** Check app notification settings and internet connection
- **Wrong codes?** Ensure your phone's date/time settings are automatic

### Conclusion

You've successfully enabled Multi-Factor Authentication for your Office 365 account. Your account is now protected against unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.

This simple security measure blocks over 99.9% of account compromise attempts, making it one of the most effective ways to protect your digital identity.
