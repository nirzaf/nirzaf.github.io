Meta has recently unveiled its latest generation of large language models with the release of Llama 4, introducing two powerful variants: Llama 4 Maverick and Llama 4 Scout. These models represent a significant leap forward in open-weight AI technology, bringing impressive capabilities that challenge even the most advanced proprietary models on the market. This article explores Llama 4 Maverick's architecture, capabilities, advantages over competing models, and its limitations.

## What is Llama 4 Maverick?

Llama 4 Maverick is a state-of-the-art multimodal AI model developed by Meta, released on April 5, 2025. It's part of Meta's new Llama 4 collection, which also includes Scout (a smaller model) and Behemoth (a larger unreleased model used for distillation).

Llama 4 Maverick is Meta's first model to use a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, with 17 billion active parameters and approximately 400 billion total parameters. The model features 128 experts, with only a small subset of these experts activated for any given input token, making it computationally efficient while maintaining high performance.

As Meta describes it: "Llama 4 Maverick, a 17 billion active parameter model with 128 experts, is the best multimodal model in its class, beating GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash across a broad range of widely reported benchmarks, while achieving comparable results to the new DeepSeek v3 on reasoning and coding—at less than half the active parameters."

## Groundbreaking Technical Architecture

### Mixture-of-Experts Design

One of the most significant advancements in Llama 4 Maverick is its Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Unlike traditional "dense" AI models where every input flows through every parameter, Maverick employs a selective approach:

- **128 Routed Experts + 1 Shared Expert**: The model features 128 specialized "expert" neural networks plus one shared expert.
- **Selective Activation**: For any given token (word or image element), only the shared expert and one of the 128 specialized experts are activated, meaning only a fraction of the model's total parameters are used during processing.
- **Router Mechanism**: A specialized neural network called a router determines which expert should process each token based on the token's content.

This architecture allows Maverick to have the knowledge capacity of a much larger model (400B parameters) while maintaining the inference speed of a much smaller model (17B active parameters). As noted in a technical analysis: "This improves inference efficiency by lowering model serving costs and latency—Llama 4 Maverick can be run on a single NVIDIA H100 DGX host for easy deployment, or with distributed inference for maximum efficiency." [NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-accelerates-inference-on-meta-llama-4-scout-and-maverick/)

### Native Multimodality with Early Fusion

Llama 4 Maverick is built from the ground up to understand both text and images natively, rather than having visual capabilities "bolted on" as an afterthought:

- **Early Fusion Architecture**: Text and visual information are integrated at a fundamental level, allowing the model to process both simultaneously.
- **Enhanced Vision Encoder**: Based on MetaCLIP but specially trained with a frozen Llama model to better adapt visual information into the language model.
- **Cross-Modal Understanding**: The model can draw direct connections between elements in text and corresponding visual elements in images.

This enables more sophisticated image understanding than previous models, allowing Maverick to process up to eight images at once with good results, and it was pre-trained on up to 48 images.

### Advanced Post-Training Pipeline

Llama 4 models use a novel three-stage approach to fine-tuning:

1. **Lightweight Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: The team removed over 50% of "easy" training examples to focus on more challenging tasks.
2. **Online Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: A continuous learning process focusing on harder prompts to improve reasoning and coding.
3. **Lightweight Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**: A final refinement stage to handle edge cases and response quality.

This approach enables better preservation of complex reasoning capabilities than traditional methods, allowing the model to excel at both technical tasks and conversational abilities.

## Performance Advantages Over Other Models
