## Foundational Strategies for Better AI Coding

### Tip 1: Leverage Widely Documented Tech Stacks

Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude and GPT are trained on vast amounts of data, including code examples. This means they perform best when working with technologies they've seen frequently in their training data.

When you use popular, well-documented technologies (React, FastAPI, Supabase, Firebase, Stripe, AWS Amplify, etc.), the AI has more relevant training data to draw from. This leads to more accurate code generation and fewer "hallucinations" (incorrect or nonsensical outputs).

The benefit? Reduced errors, faster development, and more reliable AI-generated code. It's like giving your AI assistant a familiar toolbox rather than asking it to work with obscure instruments it's barely seen before.

### Tip 2: Plan Extensively Ahead of Time

While AI can write code, it's not (yet) a master architect for complex systems, especially when trying to design and implement simultaneously.

LLMs have context window limitations. Overwhelming them with too much information at once degrades performance. That's why Sean suggests dedicating a significant portion of your development time (60-70%) to planning before writing any code.

This planning should include:
- Defining the tech stack
- Mapping out the application architecture
- Identifying where different pieces of code will reside
- Acknowledging your own knowledge gaps
- Detailing main requirements for each feature
- Writing complete user stories, outlining interactions from A to Z
- Considering state management, API endpoints, payloads, database schemas, and component logic

The result? Clearer direction for the AI, more focused prompts, and ultimately, a more robust and well-structured application.

### Tip 3: Use Context Wisely

AI development tools often allow you to specify context for your prompts using "@" symbols or similar features.

Since LLMs have maximum context limits, feeding the entire codebase for every request is inefficient and can lead to the AI missing crucial details. Be selective. Provide only the necessary files, folders, or documentation relevant to the current task.

This ensures the AI focuses its processing power on the most relevant information, leading to better, more targeted results. For example, Cursor IDE's "Add context" feature allows selecting specific files or folders, giving you fine-grained control over what information the AI considers.

### Tip 4: Commit Between Conversations

The practice of frequent, small commits is a cornerstone of traditional software development and is even more critical in vibe coding.

Creating snapshots of your codebase means if the AI generates code that breaks your application, you can easily roll back to a working version. It also facilitates working on different features in parallel.

Consider the end of a "conversation" with the AI (after a specific feature or task is completed) as a natural point to commit. You can even ask the AI to help generate a commit message that accurately describes the changes made.

### Tip 5: Commit Solutions to (System) Memory

Don't solve the same problem repeatedly. Many AI IDEs have a "memory" system where you can store common solutions, code snippets, or styling preferences.

When you and the AI devise a good solution to a recurring problem (a specific debugging technique, a styling pattern), commit it to the IDE's memory. Tools like Windsurf (with "Memories") or those supporting MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers offer this functionality.

This approach saves significant time and effort and ensures consistency across your project and even future projects if using similar tech stacks.

### Tip 6: Ask the System for Multiple Perspectives

If the AI is struggling to provide a good solution or its initial attempt is flawed, don't give up immediately.

Requesting multiple approaches can "force" the AI to think more deeply and explore different solution paths. Ask the AI to:
- Brainstorm 3 (or more) potential causes and solutions
- Rank them based on likelihood of success
- Explain the reasoning behind its ranking and why each approach might or might not be valid

This often uncovers a working solution that a single-shot prompt might miss, leveraging the AI's ability to consider multiple angles simultaneously.

### Tip 7: Evaluate Outputs Against a Standard

Implement an "Evaluator-Optimizer" workflow to ensure high-quality code.

First, have the AI generate code or a solution. Then, in a separate prompt (or using a different AI agent), ask it to evaluate that output against a defined standard (your project's style guide, security best practices, performance benchmarks).

Finally, feed the critique back to the original (or an "optimizer") AI to refine the solution. For the most current best practices, use an MCP server like Perplexity or Exa AI to perform web searches.

This leads to higher quality, more robust, and more compliant code that meets professional standards.

## Advanced AI Collaboration Techniques

### Tip 8: Strategic Model Selection

Not all LLMs are created equal, and different models excel at different tasks.

Be prepared to switch between models based on the task at hand:
- Claude 3.x (Sonnet, Opus) is often cited as excellent for coding and planning
- Google's Gemini models are also strong contenders
- Open-source models offer alternatives
- Tools like Manus intelligently combine different models for different sub-tasks within a larger workflow

Optimizing your model selection for each stage of development can significantly improve your results.

### Tip 9: Use Project Rules

Project rules are an "unsung hero" of AI coding, providing safeguards and guidelines that ensure consistency and help the AI understand project-specific conventions.

Define rules for frontend development, backend development, styling, dependencies, etc. These rules are passed as context to the LLM with relevant prompts. For a great repository of pre-built rules, check out cursor.directory.

This approach produces more consistent code, ensures adherence to best practices, and prevents the AI from making arbitrary decisions like injecting redundant libraries.

### Tip 10: Embrace Detailed Task Planning

This bridges the gap between high-level architecture and line-by-line code implementation.

Breaking down a large project into manageable, granular, step-by-step tasks for the AI makes the development process more structured and predictable. Tools like the open-source Claude Taskmaster can take your project plan (from Tip 2) and generate a detailed task list.

This provides a clear roadmap, makes it easier to track progress, implement features sequentially, and ensures the overall project architecture is respected.

### Tip 11: Adopt a Design-First Approach

Before coding features, design the user experience to prevent building features that are clunky, don't meet user needs, or require significant rework later due to UI/UX conflicts.

Design all screens for a feature, considering different states of each screen (blank state, error state, success state, loading state, user interaction states). Only then, begin coding the underlying features.

This leads to a more coherent user experience and more efficient development by front-loading UI/UX considerations, reducing the need for major revisions later.

## Optimizing Your AI Development Environment

### Tip 12: Pick an IDE That's Right for You

The market is flooded with AI-powered IDEs and tools (Cursor, Windsurf, Augment, Codium, RooCode, etc.), each with different strengths, weaknesses, pricing models, and learning curves.

Don't just follow trends or influencers. Choose an IDE based on:
- Your current experience level
- Your budget
- Your personal preferences and workflow

Avoid "perpetual tool FOMO" (Fear Of Missing Out). Stick with what works for you and gives you the most productive environment.

### Tip 13: Create Custom Modes for Custom Use Cases

Many AI IDEs allow you to create "custom modes" or specialized personas that tailor the AI's behavior and system prompts for frequently performed, specific tasks.

Define a mode with a specific role definition and instructions, such as:
- A "Debugging Mode" trained on your preferred debugging methodology
- An "Architect Mode" for brainstorming new features according to your planning style

RooCode, for instance, has an extensive custom mode system that allows for highly specialized AI assistance.

This dramatically improves workflow efficiency and results in more predictable and successful outcomes for those tasks.

### Tip 14: Configure Up-to-Date Documentation

The AI landscape and tech stacks evolve rapidly. Using outdated documentation is a recipe for disaster.

Ensure the AI is working with the latest information by:
- Direct IDE Indexing: Tools like Cursor and Windsurf allow you to provide a URL to documentation, which they will then index. Re-index when docs are updated.
- Manual Scraping: Scrape the documentation yourself, save it in a project folder, and use the "@" feature to provide this folder as context.
- MCP Servers: Tools like Context7 can pull up-to-date docs directly from their own indexed databases.

This ensures the AI generates code based on current standards, leading to fewer bugs and less frustration.

## Debugging and Maintenance Strategies

### Tip 15: Add Early Returns & Logging When Debugging

When you're stuck on a bug, give the AI more information to work with.

LLMs are surprisingly adept at diagnosing issues if they can "see" the execution flow and variable states. Ask the AI to instrument the problematic code with:
- Early returns: To isolate where the logic might be failing
- Robust console logging: To output variable values and execution points

Feed these logs back to the AI to help it (and you) pinpoint errors much faster. This can even be built into custom debugging modes (Tip 13).

### Tip 16: Use Checkpoint Restores

This feature is hailed by Sean as "one of the greatest contributions to the vibe coding universe."

It acts as a "poor man's version" of a code commit within a chat session. If an AI-generated change breaks your code, you can instantly revert to a previous, working state in the conversation.

IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf offer "Restore Checkpoint" options within their chat interfaces, saving you from manually undoing complex changes or losing a working state due to an overly ambitious or incorrect AI prompt.

### Tip 17: Understand It Before You Accept It

Don't blindly accept AI-generated code. You are ultimately responsible for the code, and understanding it helps you catch errors the AI might miss, learn, and become a better developer.

Actually read the code the AI produces. If you don't understand a part, ask the AI to explain it or detail how specific sections work.

This improves your own coding skills, leads to higher quality code, saves money on unnecessary follow-up requests to fix misunderstood code, and enables you to tackle more complex problems in the future.

## Project Management and Best Practices

### Tip 18: MVP First, Then Enhance

Focus on building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) before adding all the bells and whistles.

This avoids the common pitfall of spending vast amounts of time building an extensive application only to find users don't want or use most of its features (Sean shares a personal anecdote of spending 1.5 years on such a project).

Identify the absolute simplest, core version of your product that delivers value. Build that first. Get user feedback. Then, incrementally enhance it based on that feedback.

This validates your core idea quickly, saves development time and resources, and ensures you're building something users actually need.

### Tip 19: Clearly Identify Tech in Project Rules

This reinforces Tip 9, specifically for your tech stack.

Prevent the LLM from randomly introducing new, unapproved, or redundant libraries and tools to solve a problem when a perfectly good solution already exists within your chosen stack. This is especially problematic with tech you're less familiar with.

Within your project rules, explicitly list your core technologies and their intended purposes (e.g., "Use React Lucid for icons," "Use TailwindCSS for styling").

This maintains codebase consistency and predictability and avoids unnecessary dependencies that can bloat your project.

### Tip 20: Implement Regular Security Checks

Security should not be an afterthought in any development process, including AI-assisted coding.

AI can inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly guided, such as exposing authentication tokens on the frontend.

Use the Evaluator-Optimizer workflow (Tip 7) to regularly check critical parts of your codebase (especially authentication and data handling) against known security best practices and potential vulnerabilities. Use MCP tools for up-to-date threat intelligence if needed.

This protects your users and your application, builds trust, and helps you avoid costly security breaches.

### Tip 21: Create New Conversations as Needed

Don't let your AI chat conversations become bloated with irrelevant history.

As mentioned in Tip 3, LLMs have context limits. Long, rambling conversations with many unrelated tangents can confuse the AI and degrade the quality of its responses for the current task.

When you've logically completed a distinct task or chain of thought:
- Commit your changes (Tip 4)
- Start a new conversation for the next distinct task

This keeps the AI's context focused and relevant, leading to better performance, more accurate code, and more efficient use of tokens (which can save money if you're using paid services).

## Conclusion

By incorporating these 21 tips into your AI vibe coding practice, you can significantly reduce frustration, improve the quality of your output, and get closer to that "ultimate vibe coding glory" that so many developers are chasing.

Remember that effective AI coding is a partnership; your understanding and guidance are key to unlocking the AI's full potential. The AI is a powerful tool, but you're still the architect and decision-maker in the development process.
