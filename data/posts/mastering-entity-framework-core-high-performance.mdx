# Mastering Entity Framework Core for High-Performance Data Access

## EF Core Basics Recap

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a modern object-database mapper (ORM) for .NET. It simplifies data access by allowing developers to work with databases using .NET objects, abstracting away much of the boilerplate code typically associated with database interactions.

Key Concepts:
- **DbContext:** Represents a session with the database and is used to query and save data. It's derived from `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext`.
- **DbSet<TEntity>:** Represents a collection of entities of a specific type in the context. You use `DbSet` properties on your `DbContext` to query tables.
- **Entities:** Plain Old CLR Objects (POCOs) that represent the data in your database tables.
- **LINQ to Entities:** Allows you to write database queries in C# using Language Integrated Query (LINQ). EF Core translates these LINQ queries into SQL.
- **Migrations:** A way to incrementally evolve your database schema as your model changes over time.

A typical `DbContext` setup:
```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

public class BloggingContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Post> Posts { get; set; }

    public BloggingContext(DbContextOptions<BloggingContext> options)
        : base(options)
    {
    }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        // Configure entity relationships, keys, etc.
        modelBuilder.Entity<Blog>()
            .HasMany(b => b.Posts)
            .WithOne(p => p.Blog)
            .HasForeignKey(p => p.BlogId);
    }
}

public class Blog
{
    public int BlogId { get; set; }
    public string Url { get; set; }
    public List<Post> Posts { get; set; } = new List<Post>();
}

public class Post
{
    public int PostId { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Content { get; set; }
    public int BlogId { get; set; }
    public Blog Blog { get; set; }
}
```
This recap sets the stage for diving into more advanced performance topics.

## Efficient Querying

Writing efficient queries is crucial for performance. EF Core provides several ways to optimize how data is fetched.

### 1. Projections with `Select`

Only query the data you actually need. Loading entire entities when you only require a few properties can lead to unnecessary data transfer and memory usage.

```csharp
// Instead of this:
// var blogs = await context.Blogs.ToListAsync(); // Fetches all columns for all blogs

// Use projection:
var blogTitles = await context.Blogs
    .Select(b => new { b.BlogId, b.Url }) // Select only Id and Url
    .ToListAsync();

// You can project into DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) or anonymous types.
public class BlogDto
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string WebsiteUrl { get; set; }
}

var blogDtos = await context.Blogs
    .Select(b => new BlogDto { Id = b.BlogId, WebsiteUrl = b.Url })
    .ToListAsync();
```
**Benefit:** Reduces data transfer from the database and memory footprint of results.

### 2. No-Tracking Queries with `AsNoTracking()`

For read-only scenarios where you don't intend to modify the fetched entities, use `AsNoTracking()`. This tells EF Core not to track changes for these entities, which saves CPU time and memory.

```csharp
var blogs = await context.Blogs
    .AsNoTracking() // Disables change tracking
    .Where(b => b.Url.Contains("dotnet"))
    .ToListAsync();

// Use AsNoTrackingWithIdentityResolution() if you have multiple entities of the same type
// in your results and want to ensure they are the same instance (EF Core 7.0+).
// For most read-only scenarios, AsNoTracking() is sufficient.
```
**Benefit:** Speeds up query execution and reduces memory overhead, especially for large result sets. **Caution:** Do not use if you plan to update the fetched entities and call `SaveChanges()`.

### 3. Split Queries for Related Data (`AsSplitQuery()`)

When loading related entities (e.g., a Blog and its Posts), EF Core might generate a single SQL query that can suffer from "cartesian explosion" if a blog has many posts, leading to redundant data. `AsSplitQuery()` tells EF Core to generate separate SQL queries for each included collection.

```csharp
// Default behavior (Single Query - can be inefficient for many related entities)
var blogsWithPostsSingle = await context.Blogs
    .Include(b => b.Posts) // Loads blogs and their posts
    .ToListAsync();

// Using Split Query
var blogsWithPostsSplit = await context.Blogs
    .Include(b => b.Posts)
    .AsSplitQuery() // Generates separate queries for Blogs and Posts
    .ToListAsync();
```
**Benefit:** Can significantly improve performance and reduce data transfer for queries involving multiple `Include` operations on collections.
**Caution:** Involves multiple database roundtrips. Test to see if it's beneficial for your specific scenario. This is a global setting in older EF Core versions but can be applied per-query in newer versions.

### 4. Filtering and Ordering at the Database

Always try to filter and order data as much as possible at the database server using LINQ `Where`, `OrderBy`, `Skip`, `Take` etc., before fetching it into memory.

```csharp
var recentPosts = await context.Posts
    .Where(p => p.PublishDate > DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-7))
    .OrderByDescending(p => p.PublishDate)
    .Take(10) // Only fetch top 10
    .ToListAsync();
```
**Benefit:** Minimizes data transfer and processing on the client side. `Skip()` and `Take()` are essential for pagination.

## Change Tracking Deep Dive

EF Core's change tracking is powerful but can impact performance if not understood.

- **How it Works:** When you query entities and don't use `AsNoTracking()`, EF Core takes a snapshot of the entity's original values. When `SaveChanges()` is called, EF Core compares the current values with the snapshot to determine what has changed and generates the appropriate `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements.
- **`DetectChanges()`:** This method is called automatically by methods like `SaveChanges()` and `DbSet<TEntity>.Local` to discover any changes made to tracked entities. For performance-critical operations with many entities, you might want to manage when `DetectChanges()` is called.
    - `context.ChangeTracker.AutoDetectChangesEnabled = false;` can disable automatic calls, but then you must manually call `context.ChangeTracker.DetectChanges()` before `SaveChanges()` if changes have occurred. This is an advanced technique and should be used cautiously.
- **Attaching Entities:**
    - `context.Update(entity);` Marks the entire entity as `Modified`. This means all its properties will be updated in the database, even if only one changed.
    - `context.Attach(entity);` Attaches an entity to the context in the `Unchanged` state. You can then modify its properties and EF Core will track those specific changes.
    - `context.Entry(entity).State = EntityState.Modified;` Another way to mark an entity as modified.
    - For updating only specific fields:
    ```csharp
    var blog = new Blog { BlogId = 1, Url = "http://newurl.com" }; // Only Url is intended to change
    context.Blogs.Attach(blog); // Attach in Unchanged state
    context.Entry(blog).Property(b => b.Url).IsModified = true; // Mark only Url as modified
    // context.Entry(blog).Property("Url").IsModified = true; // Alternative using property name
    await context.SaveChangesAsync();
    // This will generate an UPDATE statement that only sets the Url.
    ```

**Performance Considerations:**
- Tracking many entities consumes memory and CPU.
- `SaveChanges()` can be slow if it needs to detect changes across thousands of tracked entities.
- **Solution:**
    - Use `AsNoTracking()` for read-only operations.
    - For bulk updates, consider specialized libraries like `EFCore.BulkExtensions` or use raw SQL (see later section) if performance is critical and you're updating many records with the same logic.
    - Add and update entities judiciously. Attach existing entities and mark specific properties as modified if you know what changed, rather than querying, modifying, and saving.

## Concurrency Control

When multiple users or processes can modify the same data simultaneously, you need a strategy to prevent conflicts. EF Core supports optimistic concurrency control.

- **How it Works:** A concurrency token (a property on your entity) is used to check if the data has changed since it was queried.
    - Mark a property as a concurrency token using the `[Timestamp]` attribute (for SQL Server `rowversion`) or `[ConcurrencyCheck]` attribute (for other property types).
    ```csharp
    public class Post
    {
        public int PostId { get; set; }
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public string Content { get; set; }
        public int BlogId { get; set; }
        public Blog Blog { get; set; }

        [Timestamp] // For SQL Server, this maps to a rowversion/timestamp column
        public byte[] RowVersion { get; set; }

        // Alternatively, for non-SQL Server or specific properties:
        // [ConcurrencyCheck]
        // public DateTime LastUpdated { get; set; }
    }
    ```
- When `SaveChanges()` is called, EF Core includes the original value of the concurrency token in the `WHERE` clause of the `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement.
- If another user has modified the row in the meantime, the concurrency token value in the database will be different, and the `WHERE` clause won't find a matching row.
- This results in a `DbUpdateConcurrencyException`.

- **Handling `DbUpdateConcurrencyException`:**
    ```csharp
    try
    {
        await context.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
    catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException ex)
    {
        // ex.Entries contains the entities that failed to save.
        foreach (var entry in ex.Entries)
        {
            if (entry.Entity is Post post)
            {
                var databaseValues = await entry.GetDatabaseValuesAsync();
                if (databaseValues == null)
                {
                    // Entity was deleted by another user.
                    Console.WriteLine($"Post {post.PostId} was deleted by another user.");
                }
                else
                {
                    // Entity was updated by another user.
                    var databasePost = (Post)databaseValues.ToObject();
                    Console.WriteLine($"Post {post.PostId} was modified by another user.");
                    // Options:
                    // 1. Reload from database: entry.Reload();
                    // 2. Keep client values and overwrite: (do nothing extra, SaveChanges again will try to overwrite)
                    // 3. Merge client and database values:
                    //    entry.OriginalValues.SetValues(databaseValues); // Update original values to DB
                    //    // Then re-apply client changes or show UI to resolve conflict
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
**Benefit:** Prevents lost updates and ensures data integrity in multi-user environments.

## Raw SQL and Stored Procedures

Sometimes, LINQ to Entities might not generate the most optimal SQL, or you need to use features not easily accessible via LINQ. EF Core allows you to drop down to raw SQL.

### 1. Raw SQL Queries

- **`FromSqlRaw()`:** Executes a raw SQL query and materializes the results into entity instances. The SQL query *must* return columns that match the properties of the entity type.
    ```csharp
    var searchTerm = ".NET";
    var blogs = await context.Blogs
        .FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Url LIKE {0}", $"%{searchTerm}%")
        .ToListAsync();
    ```
    **Important:** Always use parameterization (like `{0}` above or `DbParameter` objects) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **`ExecuteSqlRawAsync()`:** Executes a raw SQL command that doesn't necessarily return entities (e.g., `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or calling a stored procedure that doesn't return a result set). Returns the number of rows affected.
    ```csharp
    var newUrl = "http://updatedblog.com";
    var blogId = 1;
    await context.Database.ExecuteSqlRawAsync(
        "UPDATE Blogs SET Url = {0} WHERE BlogId = {1}", newUrl, blogId);
    ```

### 2. Stored Procedures

- **Querying Data:** If your stored procedure returns data that can be mapped to an entity type, you can use `FromSqlRaw`.
    ```csharp
    var posts = await context.Posts
        .FromSqlRaw("EXECUTE dbo.GetPostsForBlog @BlogId", new SqlParameter("@BlogId", 1))
        .ToListAsync();
    ```
- **Keyless Entity Types (EF Core 5.0+):** If your stored procedure returns a result set that doesn't map to one of your primary entity types, you can define a keyless entity type to consume it.
    ```csharp
    // In DbContext OnModelCreating:
    // modelBuilder.Entity<PostSummary>().HasNoKey().ToView(null); // ToView(null) for SP results

    public class PostSummary
    {
        public string BlogName { get; set; }
        public int PostCount { get; set; }
    }

    // Querying:
    var summaries = await context.Set<PostSummary>()
        .FromSqlRaw("EXECUTE dbo.GetBlogSummaries")
        .ToListAsync();
    ```
- **Non-query Stored Procedures:** Use `ExecuteSqlRawAsync`.
    ```csharp
    await context.Database.ExecuteSqlRawAsync("EXECUTE dbo.UpdatePostStats @PostId", new SqlParameter("@PostId", 10));
    ```

**When to Use:**
- When LINQ generates inefficient SQL for a critical query.
- To leverage database-specific features not available in LINQ.
- To execute complex stored procedures.
- For bulk operations where EF Core's change tracking overhead is too high (though consider libraries like `EFCore.BulkExtensions` first).

**Caution:**
- Bypasses EF Core's change tracking if you're not careful. If entities returned by `FromSqlRaw` should be tracked, ensure they are.
- Increases coupling with the database schema. Changes to SPs or table structures might require code changes.

## Performance Tuning

Beyond query optimization, other factors influence EF Core performance.

### 1. Indexing

Proper database indexing is one of the most effective ways to improve query performance.
- **Identify Slow Queries:** Use database profiling tools (e.g., SQL Server's Query Store or `EXPLAIN` in PostgreSQL/MySQL) to find queries that are slow due to missing indexes.
- **Add Indexes with Migrations:** You can define indexes in your entity configurations using the `HasIndex()` method or data annotations.
    ```csharp
    // In OnModelCreating:
    modelBuilder.Entity<Post>()
        .HasIndex(p => p.BlogId) // Index on foreign key
        .HasName("IX_Post_BlogId");

    modelBuilder.Entity<Blog>()
        .HasIndex(b => b.Url)
        .IsUnique(); // Unique index

    // Using Data Annotations on entity property:
    // [Index(nameof(Url), IsUnique = true)]
    // public string Url { get; set; }
    ```
- **Covering Indexes:** Consider creating indexes that include all columns selected by a frequent query to avoid table lookups.
- **Review Index Usage:** Periodically review if indexes are being used effectively and remove unused ones.

### 2. Caching

Caching frequently accessed, rarely changing data can significantly reduce database load.

- **Second-Level (2nd) Caching:** EF Core itself does not provide a built-in second-level cache (a cache shared across `DbContext` instances). However, you can integrate third-party solutions.
    - **EFCoreSecondLevelCacheInterceptor:** A popular library that provides an easy way to add 2nd level caching. It intercepts database commands and serves results from cache if available.
    ```csharp
    // Setup in DbContext configuration (example)
    // services.AddDbContext<BloggingContext>(options =>
    //    options.UseSqlServer(connectionString)
    //           .AddInterceptors(serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<SecondLevelCacheInterceptor>()));
    ```
    - **Considerations:** Cache invalidation strategy is crucial. Data can become stale if not invalidated correctly after updates. Suitable for data that is read often but changes infrequently.

- **Application-Level Caching:** Use `IMemoryCache` or distributed caches like Redis for caching query results or objects that don't need to be constantly fresh from the database.
    ```csharp
    public class BlogService
    {
        private readonly BloggingContext _context;
        private readonly IMemoryCache _cache;

        public BlogService(BloggingContext context, IMemoryCache cache)
        {
            _context = context;
            _cache = cache;
        }

        public async Task<List<BlogDto>> GetPopularBlogsAsync()
        {
            string cacheKey = "PopularBlogs";
            if (!_cache.TryGetValue(cacheKey, out List<BlogDto> popularBlogs))
            {
                popularBlogs = await _context.Blogs
                    .AsNoTracking()
                    .OrderByDescending(b => b.ViewCount) // Assuming ViewCount property
                    .Take(10)
                    .Select(b => new BlogDto { Id = b.BlogId, WebsiteUrl = b.Url })
                    .ToListAsync();

                var cacheEntryOptions = new MemoryCacheEntryOptions()
                    .SetSlidingExpiration(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)); // Cache for 5 mins
                _cache.Set(cacheKey, popularBlogs, cacheEntryOptions);
            }
            return popularBlogs;
        }
    }
    ```
**Benefit:** Reduces database load, lowers latency for frequently accessed data.
**Caution:** Introduces complexity related to cache coherency and stale data. Choose caching strategies carefully based on data volatility.

## Migrations Best Practices

EF Core Migrations help manage database schema changes.

- **Idempotent Scripts:** Ensure your migration scripts are idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing errors or unintended side effects. This is often the default, but be careful with custom SQL in migrations.
- **Test Migrations:** Before applying migrations to a production database, test them in a staging or development environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.
- **Backup Production Data:** Always back up your production database before applying any migration.
- **Minimize Downtime:**
    - For large schema changes that might lock tables for extended periods, consider strategies like:
        - Applying migrations during off-peak hours.
        - Using techniques like expanding and contracting (e.g., add new column, update app to use it, then remove old column in a later migration) for zero-downtime deployments.
- **Review Generated SQL:** Before applying a migration, use `Script-Migration` (Package Manager Console) or `dotnet ef migrations script` (CLI) to review the SQL that will be executed. Ensure it's what you expect.
- **Keep Migrations Small and Focused:** Prefer smaller, more frequent migrations over large, complex ones. This makes them easier to troubleshoot if something goes wrong.
- **Team Environments:**
    - Communicate with your team before adding or applying migrations to avoid conflicts.
    - Use a version control system for your migrations and resolve conflicts carefully. `Remove-Migration` can be used to revert the last migration if it hasn't been applied to a shared database, but be cautious.
- **Production Deployment:**
    - **Generate SQL Scripts:** For production, it's often safer to generate SQL scripts from migrations (`dotnet ef migrations script --idempotent`) and apply them manually or via a database deployment tool, rather than running `Update-Database` or `dotnet ef database update` directly against production. This gives DBAs a chance to review and control the deployment.
    - **Application Startup:** Applying migrations at application startup (`context.Database.MigrateAsync()`) is convenient for development but can be risky in multi-instance production environments (risk of multiple instances trying to migrate simultaneously). If used, ensure only one instance performs the migration (e.g., using a distributed lock or a startup task that runs on a single instance).

## Conclusion
