What is Multi-Factor Authentication?
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra security layer to your Office 365 account by requiring two forms of verification:
1. Something you know (your password)
2. Something you have (your phone with the Authenticator app)
This prevents unauthorized access even if your password is compromised. Microsoft reports that MFA blocks over 99.9% of account compromise attempts.

Step 2: Configure Office 365 Account
On your computer:


Go to portal.office.com and sign in


Access MFA settings:

If prompted with "More information required" or "Set up your account", click "Next" or "Set it up now"

Otherwise, go directly to https://aka.ms/mfasetup


On the Security info page:

Click "+ Add sign-in method"
Select "Authenticator app" from the dropdown
Choose "Receive notifications for verification"
Click "Set up"
A QR code will appear â€” keep this window open

Step 3: Link Your Account
On your phone:

Open the Microsoft Authenticator app
Tap the + icon in the top-right corner
Select "Work or school account"
Allow camera access if prompted
Scan the QR code displayed on your computer screen



Complete setup:

After scanning, your account will appear in the app
Return to your computer and click "Next"
A test notification will be sent to your phone
Tap "Approve" on your phone
On your computer, you'll see "Your configuration was successful"
Click "Next"



Tip: If scanning fails, look for a manual code entry option on the setup screen

Step 4: Add a Backup Method
Adding a backup method is critical in case you lose access to your phone or the Authenticator app.

When prompted, select "Phone" as your backup method
Enter your mobile number with country code (e.g., +1 for USA)
Choose "Text message" for verification (recommended)
Click "Next"



You'll receive a verification code via text message
Enter this code on your computer and click "Verify"
Click "Done" to complete setup


Using MFA After Setup
Daily Sign-in Process:
1. Enter your email and password as usual
2. You'll receive either:
   - A push notification on your phone (tap Approve)
   - A prompt to enter a verification code from the app
Important Security Tips:
- Only approve sign-ins you initiated yourself
- If you receive an unexpected authentication request, deny it and change your password immediately
- Keep your phone secure as it's now part of your login security
Troubleshooting

Lost phone? Use your backup phone number to sign in
No notifications? Check app notification settings and internet connection
Wrong codes? Ensure your phone's date/time settings are automatic
