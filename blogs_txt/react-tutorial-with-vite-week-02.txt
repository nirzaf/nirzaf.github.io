React 19 is the latest stable version of the popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Vite is a modern build tool that offers blazing-fast development and optimized production builds. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up React 19 with Vite to create a fast, modern web application environment.
Why Use Vite &amp; React 19?

  
    ⚡ Why Use Vite?
    
      Lightning-fast hot module replacement
      No bundling during development
      Optimized builds with Rollup
      Out-of-the-box TypeScript support
    
  
  
    ⚛️ React 19 Features
    
      React Compiler for improved performance
      New server-side rendering architecture
      Enhanced concurrent features
      Improved developer experience
    
  


Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have:

Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher, v20+ recommended)
npm or yarn
A code editor (VS Code recommended)


Tip: To check your Node.js version, run:
bash
node -v

Step-by-Step Installation
1. Create a New Vite Project
Open your terminal and run:
bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
Replace my-react-app with your desired project name.
2. Navigate to Your Project Directory
bash
cd my-react-app
3. Upgrade to React 19
By default, Vite may create a project with React 18. Upgrade to React 19:
bash
npm install react@^19.0.0 react-dom@^19.0.0

Note: In the future, Vite's React template might include React 19 by default.

4. Install React Compiler (Optional)
To leverage the new React Compiler features in React 19, install the Babel plugin:
bash
npm install -D @babel/plugin-react-compiler
5. Configure Vite to Use React Compiler
Open your vite.config.js and add the plugin:
```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react({
      babel: {
        plugins: ['@babel/plugin-react-compiler']
      }
    })
  ],
});
```
6. Change Default Port (Optional)
To use port 3000 instead of 5173, modify vite.config.js:
```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react({
      babel: {
        plugins: ['@babel/plugin-react-compiler']
      }
    })
  ],
  server: {
    port: 3000
  },
});
```
7. Install Dependencies and Start the Dev Server
bash
npm install
npm run dev
Your React 19 app should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or port 5173 if unchanged).
Verifying React 19 Installation
To confirm your project uses React 19, display the React version in your app:
```jsx
// In App.jsx
import React, { version } from 'react';
function App() {
  return (
    
      React 19 with Vite
      Current React Version: {version}
    
  );
}
export default App;
```
This will show the current React version in your app, confirming React 19 is installed.
Troubleshooting
Package Version Conflicts
If you encounter version conflicts, clear your npm cache and reinstall:
bash
npm cache clean --force
npm install
Compiler Plugin Issues
If the React Compiler plugin causes issues, you can remove it and still use React 19 without compiler features:

Remove the plugin from vite.config.js
Uninstall the package:
   bash
   npm uninstall @babel/plugin-react-compiler

Next Steps

  
    Add Dependencies
    Consider adding these popular libraries:
    
      React Router for navigation
      Tailwind CSS for styling
      Axios for API requests
    
  
  
    Project Structure
    Organize your project with these folders:
    
      src/components/ - Reusable components
      src/pages/ - Page components
      src/hooks/ - Custom React hooks
      src/context/ - Context providers
