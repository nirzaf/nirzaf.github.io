1. Build the project after every change:
   Command:
     bun run build

2. If the build completes without errors, terminate any running Node.js processes (to avoid conflicts):
   Command:
     killall node

3. Start the development server:
   Command:
     bun dev

4. Test the project:
   Command:
     bun test

5. If all tests pass and the project is working as expected, push your changes:
   Command:
     git push

Tip: Always follow this sequence to ensure a clean and reliable workflow.
if all good then push, keep this as global memory
